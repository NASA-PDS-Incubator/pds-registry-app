<ul>
  <li>Elasticsearch server is running.</li>
  <li>Registry Manager command-line tool is installed.</li>

<subsection name="Delete Data" id="Delete">

<p>
You can delete metadata by lidvid, lid, package id (Harvest job id), or delete all data. 
Few examples are shown below.

<h4>Delete by LIDVID</h4>
<source>
registry-manager delete-data \
    -lidvid urn:nasa:pds:context:target:asteroid.4_vesta::1.1 \
    -es https://my-server.my-domain.com:9999 \
    -index registry \
    -auth path/to/auth.cfg
</source>

<p>
NOTE: "-es" (Elasticsearch URL), "-index" (Elasticsearch index name), and "-auth" (authentication file) 
parameters are optional. Default Elasticsearch URL is "http://localhost:9200".
</p>

<p>
If your Elasticsearch server requires authentication, you have to create an authentication configuration file
and provide following parameters:
</p>

<source>
# true - trust self-signed certificates; false - don't trust.
trust.self-signed = true
user = pds-user1
password = mypassword
</source>

<h4>Delete by LID</h4>
<source>
registry-manager delete-data \
    -lid urn:nasa:pds:context:target:asteroid.4_vesta
    -es http://localhost:9200
</source>

<h4>Delete by Package / Job ID</h4>
<source>
registry-manager delete-data \
    -packageId 8d8ae96d-044e-473d-a278-62635b1c5977
</source>

<h4>Delete all Data</h4>
<source>
registry-manager delete-data -all -index test1
</source>

</p>
